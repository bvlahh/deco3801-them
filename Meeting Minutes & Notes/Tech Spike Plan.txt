For Tech Spike:
Single error being detected
Direct input - error
Single file - error & no error (so error bar needs to show this)
 -- red = Structure/syntax
 -- blue = depreciated elements 
 -- orange = accessibility
 -- yellow = poor practice / misc
Multiple files - multi-file page linking to individual file page
Zip upload - displays directory structure (need folder and file images for this)
